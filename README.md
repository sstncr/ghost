ghost
=====

Simple mobile robot (autonomous or controled over serial interface).

The original name was "naluca" (in Romanian) which is loosely translated to ghost.

On a sunny day, I should add some explanations about the hardware used (a custom ATmega16 board, similiar to Arduino designs),
how connections are made (sensors, drivers/motors), schematics, etc.
