ghost
=====

Simple mobile robot (autonomous or controlled over a serial interface). In autonomous mode it avoids obstacles (or it's trying to :)),
and prints on the serial interface sensors values in certain places (when the color of the surface under the robot it's similar to
the starting surface). In manual mode you have full control (e.g move with w/a/s/d keys).

The original name was "naluca" (in Romanian) which is loosely translated to ghost.

On a sunny day, I should add some explanations about the hardware used (a custom ATmega16 board, similiar to Arduino designs),
how connections are made (sensors, drivers/motors), schematics, etc.
